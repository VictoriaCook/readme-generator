# README Generator

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using Inquirer and fs.

## How it works

The user is presented with a series of prompts for the content of the README file. Once the user has answered all prompts, the user responses are populated into a README.md file located in the output folder. The section containing the user's chosen licence includes a link to the corresponding GitHub license page as well as a GitHub badge for that licence type.

To start the application, enter 'node index.js' in the command line and follow the prompts.
