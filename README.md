# README Generator

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using Inquirer and fs.

## How the generator works

The user is presented with a series of prompts for the content of the README file. Once the user has answered all prompts, the user responses are populated into a README.md file located in the 'output' folder. The section containing the user's chosen licence includes a link to the corresponding GitHub license page as well as a GitHub badge for that licence type. The user will be able to restart the application to generate a new README file. This will overwrite the existing README file.

## Installation

To start the application, please complete the following steps:

1. Open the repo in the local environment.
2. Install Inquirer v8.2.4 by entering 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' in the command line.
3. Enter 'node index.js' in the command line and follow the prompts.
4. Navigate to the README.md file in the 'output' folder.
